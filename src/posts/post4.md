Johannes Brahms meticulously crafted his "A German Requiem" over several years, revealing its evolution from a three-movement piece in 1867 to a seven-movement work in 1869. Unlike a commissioned work, Brahms undertook this project as a personal endeavor to convey his innermost sentiments. The composition defies conventional requiem structures, a testament to Brahms' innovative approach.

In a letter to Carl Martin Reinthaler in 1867, Brahms mused about omitting "German" from the title, opting for "Human" instead. The reason he did not, however, is likely that Brahms makes it clear that this is one of many possible ways to remember the dead: where a Latin requiem could be expected to follow the rules of its tradition, a German requiem involves personal choice. The text of the Requiem is drawn from the Bible, weaving together passages from the Old Testament, Apocrypha, and New Testament. This compilation forms a unique literary creation, imbued with novel meanings and interpretations.
