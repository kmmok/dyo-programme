Mozart's Third Violin Concerto, composed in 1775 at the age of 19, was referred to by him as the "Straßburg-Concert." This moniker likely originates from a motif found in the central section of the third movement, reminiscent of a local dance. The concerto, presented in G major, exudes considerable charm and showcases Mozart's exploration of innovative ideas within a Rococo-Classical framework.

Bridging symphonic and operatic realms, the concerto intertwines with Mozart's opera "Il rè pastore", evident in the first movement's (Allegro’s) opening theme, also featured in the aria "Aer tranquillo e dì sereni." Notably, the piece takes on an operatic quality, briefly transitioning into a solo violin recitative before the sonata-form's recapitulation.

The Adagio, a lyrical violin aria, unfolds leisurely. Unique orchestration sets it apart, with orchestral violins and violas muted, cellos and double basses plucking their strings. This shift results in a softer, altered timbre, while the substitution of flutes for oboes further refines the texture. 

The Rondeau (Rondo) finale, re-establishing the first movement's instrumentation, features tempo and meter variations. Despite its overall triple time, the movement halts, shifting to duple meter and a slower tempo, accompanied by a pizzicato orchestral accompaniment. The solo violin introduces a tip-toeing theme, shrouding the piece in mystery. A swift Allegretto ensues, the orchestra now resuming its major key. A lengthy development of this lively melody leads to the return of the rondo theme and triple meter, bringing the movement to a close.
